<h1 align="center"> Hi 👋, I am Fulvio! Welcome! 😊	<br/> </h1>




* 🤖 Artificial Intelligence and Robotics student at Sapienza University of Rome (Italy).
* 🥽 I want to give my contribution to the world of research. I love dealing with SLAM, Computer Vision, and a lot of Math!
* 🧠 Ok there is something more, I am developing an interest in Neuroscience and Machine Learning for health and sport activities!
* 🙏 I am part of a big family, namely [LeadTheFutureMentorship](https://leadthefuture.tech/?v=cd32106bcb6d). We help young, emerging italian students to take their best career path. I am happy to be part of this talent network, and to give back!

I don't set limits; I don't quantify exactly my future goals. Too high means failure. Too low means mediocrity. Instead, I set for the direction.
**Day by day is the key, for me**. <br/>
My direction is studying hard and get passionate about the topics I cover. <br/>
My direction is working side my side with other brilliant minds in my field. <br/>
My direction is enjoyng the process, not the finish line 🏁. When you see the checkered flag, it's the end of the game. <br/>
For me, the game has just started!

# Leisure Time #
I am a fan of an old latin motto: *mens sana in corpore sano* <br/>
In my free time, I enjoy pursuing a career as a professional athlete!
