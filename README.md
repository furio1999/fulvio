<h1 align="center"> Hi 👋, I am Fulvio! Welcome! 😊	<br/> </h1>




* 🤖 Artificial Intelligence and Robotics student at [Sapienza University of Rome (Italy)](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/en/corso/2021/30431/home).
* 🚀 Visiting Student at European Space Agency, [Φ-Lab](https://philab.esa.int/about/).
* 🥽 I want to give my contribution to the world of research. I love 3D reconstruction and Generative AI applied to Earth Monitoring, Robot Navigation and Sport.
* 🙏 I am part of a big family, namely [LeadTheFutureMentorship](https://leadthefuture.tech/?v=cd32106bcb6d). We help young, emerging italian students to take their best career path. I am happy to be part of this talent network, and to give back!

I don't set limits; I don't quantify exactly my future goals. Too high means failure. Too low means mediocrity. Instead, I set for the direction.
**Day by day is the key, for me**. <br/>
My direction is studying hard and get passionate about the topics I cover. <br/>
My direction is working side my side with other brilliant minds in my field. <br/>
My direction is enjoyng the process, not the finish line 🏁. When you see the checkered flag, it's the end of the game. <br/>
For me, the game has just started!

# Leisure Time #
I am a fan of an old latin motto: *mens sana in corpore sano* <br/>
In my free time, I enjoy pursuing a career as a professional athlete!



I am joking of course 😉
In general, I love doing this: 🏊  🚲  🏃‍♂️,  actually I am looking also for new adventures ⛰️ on the mountain trails near home! <br/>
If you reeeaally like to have a look, go 👉 to my [strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/34389247)

Ok, now back to engineering stuff!! Enjoy! 😃
